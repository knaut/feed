# Feed ðŸŒ±
*Feed* (https://www.feed-app.net) is a decentralized social networking utility powered by blockchain technology via Blockstack (https://blockstack.org).

## Nutshell ðŸŒ°
*Feed* is a React & Redux application running a lightweight custom backend to store data on Blockstack's decentralized file storage system, Gaia.

User authentication on the blockchain is done via Blockstack ID.

Uses Grommet v2 for pre-fabbed UI components.

## Features
- **Post statuses up to 500 characters** - post simple text statuses within a 500 character limit
- **Shareable permalinks** - every post has a permalink whose URL can be shared anywhere
- **Search Blockstack IDs** - search for other Feed users by their Blockstack ID.

All posted data is public to the world (thus unencrypted).

This featureset will expand with future releases.
